Howzit GitHub,

Just starting out, Huge newbie but really enjoying coding. 

Plan is to continue upgrading my code in my initial projects, Until I can code a few card drinking games that I play with my mates. (Higher or Lower and S$#@head)

Baby steps until I can code some stuff that would really help out at work.

Cheers!
